# Clinical-Expert-System
This Python program is a simple rule-based clinical expert system that helps decide what action to take based on basic symptoms.
It uses a decision tree made of connected nodes — each node asks a yes/no question and follows a path depending on the answer.
At the end of the questions, it gives a recommendation such as “Call ambulance,” “Visit the doctor,” or “Try a home remedy.”
The program also saves each patient’s name, age, gender, and diagnosis result into a text file for record-keeping.
It demonstrates basic AI concepts like knowledge representation, inference, and decision-making.
The system is small, fast, and easy to expand with more symptoms or medical conditions.
Perfect for learning how expert systems and decision trees work in artificial intelligence.
